called
into
Bill

a.m.
Donald
Trump
has
traded
his
usual
large-scale
rallies
for
an
intimate
town
hall
setting
.
The
Democratic
race
has
taken
a
turn
for
the
nasty
as
Clinton
and
Sanders
explore
their
newfound
aggressiveness
,
each
suddenly
willing
to
get
personal
as
Sanders
rides
an
impressive
winning
streak
and
as
Clinton
readies
for
her
own
.
Tuesday
's
contests
--
Clinton
won
in
Delaware
,
Connecticut
,
Maryland
and
Pennsylvania
,
while
Sanders
won
Rhode
Island
--
gave
Clinton
a
nearly
insurmountable
lead
in
pledged
delegates
,
and
she
already
was
way
ahead
of
Sanders
in
superdelegates
,
the
unpledged
party
leaders
and
officials
who
may
support
the
candidate
of
their
choice
at
the
convention
.
As
of
Wednesday
,
Clinton
had
90
%
of
the
delegates
needed
to
clinch
the
nomination
.
Standing
alongside
labor
leader
and
civil
rights
activist
Dolores
Huerta
,
who
co-founded
the
United
Farm
Workers
,
and
Dream
Act
activist
Dan-el
Padilla
Peralta
,
Mark-Viverito
accused
Sanders
of
being
inactive
in
the
years-long
effort
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
and
chided
him
for
siding
with
Republicans
.
At
Clinton
's
New
York
campaign
headquarters
,
her
advisers
are
grappling
with
how
to
convince
swing
voters
that
a
former
secretary
of
state
,
senator
and
first
lady
who
owns
a
home
in
Washington
,
has
cultivated
deep
ties
to
Wall
Street
and
has
played
a
starring
role
in
the
political
scene
for
a
quarter-century
would
usher
in
change
.
Indeed
,
proponents
of
more
controls
on
hate
speech
here
say
there
is
a
direct
correlation
to
the
vitriol
now
flying
in
the
German
public
domain
and
the
sharp
spike
of
attacks
on
refugee
centers
.
Last
year
,
German
police
reported
906
attacks
against
asylum
seeker
homes
,
ranging
from
arson
to
physical
assaults
.
The
figure
amounts
to
more
than
a
fourfold
increase
,
compared
with
2014
numbers
.
Demonstrators
picket
every
political
convention
,
but
there
is
added
security
concern
here
because
punches
have
already
been
thrown
at
Trump
rallies
-
including
last
week
in
San
Jose
.
Cleveland
police
have
insisted
they
are
prepared
for
the
thousands
of
people
who
love
Trump
sharing
the
streets
with
thousands
who
detest
him

She
went
on
to
attack
Donald

,
saying
the
presumptive
Republican
nominee
``

more
skeptical

Mr.

Rob

cautioned
that
even

Mr.
Trump
does
retain
substantial
support
among
white
male
union
members
without
college
degrees
,
that
will
not
necessarily
yield
him
an
electoral
advantage
in
November
if
he
becomes
the
Republican
nominee
.
``

said

was

a

dramatic

In

argument

Senate

make
any
headway

During
the

dictum
that
the
Soviet
Union
was
an
``
evil
empire

bent
on
world
domination

formed
to
contain
its
expansionist
ambitions

arsenals

it

arms
