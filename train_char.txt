In
October
,
as
it
became
apparent
that
the
real
estate
showman
's
position
atop
GOP
primary
polls
was
more
than
a
short-lived
fluke
,
his
campaign
sought
proposals
from
multiple
companies
that
provide
data
and
modeling
to
help
candidates
identify
persuadable
voters
and
mobilize
core
supporters
,
including
the
nonpartisan
political
data
firms
L2
and
rVotes
,
according
to
sources
.
They
said
the
campaign
ultimately
entered
into
an
agreement
with
L2
,
which
worked
with
Braynard
and
Chrabaszcz
to
tailor
data
for
the
campaign

Despite
that

struggling

grab
the
prize
he
has
eyed
all
year
:
to
be
invited
to
the
televised
presidential
debates

He
needs
to
close
in

said
in

were

bill
,
also
introduced
in
the
Senate

180

Republicans
quickly
pounced
on
the
administration
's
policy
announcement
by
tying
it
to
unauthorized
immigration

,
in
Sen.

He
and
House
Judiciary
Committee
Chairman
Bob
Goodlatte
(
R-Va
.
)
both
condemned
the
Central
American
Minors
program
in
statements
because
certain
undocumented
immigrants
with
temporary
protected
status
or
deferred
action
protections
are
eligible
to
bring
their
children
.
Goodlatte
said
the
expansion
of
the
program
was
``
simply
a
continuation
of
the
government-sanctioned
border
surge
.
''
This
story
has
been
updated
with
additional
reactions
from
members
of
Congress
and
refugee
advocates
.
``
He
truly
cares
about
the
American
people
,
''
she
said
of
Trump
.
But
their
different
attitudes
towards
the
Obama
era
could
still
have
political
significance
.
Supporters
of
Sanders
would
argue
--
and
Sanders
presumably
believes
--
that
his
pitch
better
fits
the
mood
of
the
electorate
,
given
that
polls
consistently
show
majorities
of
Americans
believe
the
country
is
on
the
``
wrong
track
''
and
large
numbers
of
people
really
are
struggling
with
stagnant
wages
and
high
medical
bills
.
Running
so
heavily
on
the
Obama
record
sure
makes
less
sense
when
that
record
does
n't
excite
the
public
.
No
clear
favorites
going
into
New

Hooking
people
on
your
news
product
is
a
lot
harder
than
,
say
,
hooking
them
on
heroin
or
even
coffee
.
But
news
organizations
have
ways
they
never
had
before
to
figure
it
out
.
As
for
Trump
,
since
the
Republican
National
Convention
ended
last
month
,
he
and
running
mate
Mike
Pence
have
been
to
10
of
the
counties
identified
by
POLITICO
as
among
the
most
critical
for
winning
the
election
.
That
includes
stops
just
in
the
last
week
to
Loudoun
County
in
Virginia
,
Duval

In
the
95
minute
rant
against
everyone
from
Carson
to

WASHINGTON
--
Something
rare
happened
Monday
.
Senate
Majority
Leader
Mitch
McConnell
(
R-Ky
.
)
let
a
judicial
nominee
get
a
vote
:
Waverly
Crenshaw
,
a
Tennessee
district
court
nominee
.
It
's
been
two
months
since
Republicans
confirmed
a
judge
.
If
anybody
should
have
been
confirmed
by
now
,
it
's
Crenshaw
.
Nobody
opposed
him
--
he
was
confirmed
92
to
0
.
Both
of
his
GOP
senators
strongly
supported
him
.
The
court
seat
he
's
filling
has
become
so
overloaded
with
cases
that
it
's
become
a
judicial
emergency
.
Yet
Crenshaw
,
who
unanimously
cleared
the
Judiciary
Committee
nine
months
ago
,
had
to
wait
almost
a
year
and
a
half
for
a
vote
.
If
it
takes
this
long
to
confirm
a
judge
that
Republicans
actually
like
,
things
do
n't
look
good
for
President
Barack
Obama
's
other
court
picks
.
Never
mind
the
ongoing
GOP
blockade
against
his
Supreme
Court
nominee
;
there
are
31
other
judicial
nominees
waiting
for
action
in
the
Judiciary
Committee
and
14
more
ready
to
be
confirmed
right
now
.
None
are
scheduled
for
votes
.
Republicans
are
already
confirming
judges
at
the
slowest
pace
in
more
than
50
years
--
and
the
Senate
tends
to
slow
down
confirmations
as
it
gets
closer
to
November
in
presidential
election
years
.
Crenshaw
could
be
it
for
Obama
.
McConnell
spokesman
Don
Stewart
would
n't
say
when
,
or
if
,
the
Senate
will
vote
to
confirm
the
next
judicial
nominees
on
the
list
.
``
I
do
n't
have
any
new
announcements
yet
,
''
he
said
.
The
delays
are
part
of
a
broader
GOP
strategy
to
punt
judicial
confirmations
to
next
year
,
when
a
Republican
might
be
in
the
White
House
and
nominate
people
they
like
better
.
Crenshaw
is
only
the
17th
judge
who
has
been
confirmed
since
the
GOP
became
the
Senate
majority
in
January
2015
.
By
contrast
,
in
the
final
two
years
of
President
George
W.
Bush
's
term
,
Democrats
controlled
the
Senate
and
had
confirmed
68
judicial
nominees
by
this
point
.
Court
vacancies
have
been
ticking
up
in
the
meantime
.
They
're
at
78
now
,
and
34
of
them
are
emergencies
.
When
court
seats
go
unfilled
,
people
's
cases
can
get
delayed
for
years
and
judges
struggle
with
burnout
.
There
could
be
a
little
more
movement
before
Obama
leaves
the
Oval
Office
.
Sen.
John
Cornyn
(
R-Texas
)
told
a
Politico
reporter
Monday
evening
that
he
``
would
be
surprised
if
-LSB-
Crenshaw
-RSB-
is
the
last
one
of
the

''
But
if
confirmations
do
hit
a
wall
until
2017
,
or
come
close
to
it
,
it
's
not
just
Obama
's
problem
.
There
are
GOP
senators
with
courts
in
their
states
that
desperately
need
vacancies
filled
,
and
who
may
not
get
them
anytime
soon
,
despite
the
fact
that
their
party
controls
the
Senate
.
Take
Idaho
Republican
Sens.
Mike
Crapo
and
Jim
Risch
.
Last
week
,
they
enthusiastically
endorsed
Obama
's
nomination
of
David
Nye
to
the
U.S.
District
Court
for
the
District
of
Idaho
.
That
court
has
two
seats
on
it
,
one
of
which
is
vacant
and
a
judicial
emergency
.
It
also
has
a
heavy
enough
workload
that
it
should
have
a
third
judgeship
added
to
it
,
according
to
the
U.S.
Judicial
Conference
,
the
policy-making
arm
of
the
federal
court
system
.
So
this
court
,
if
it
's
fully
functioning
,
should
have
three
judges
on
it
.
But
Nye
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
in
the
Judiciary
Committee
.
He
still
has
to
get
a
hearing
scheduled
,
have
a
hearing
,
go
through
a
round
of
follow-up
questions
from
the
hearing
,
get
voted
out
,
get
scheduled
for
a
confirmation
vote
and
then
have
a
confirmation
vote
.
There
's
time
to
get
through
all
of
that
between
now
and
the
end
of
the
year
,
but
if
Republicans
plan
to
move
judges
in
order
--
and
at
the
pace
Crenshaw
moved
--
Nye
wo
n't
get
a
vote
until
2017
or
even
early
2018
.
That
leaves
the
Idaho
court
with
one
judge
until
then
.

with
an

could
transfix

among

reading

Amid

the
scramble

the
week

can
be
forgiven
for
not
knowing
that
there
was
a
Democratic

Saturday

And
the
fact
that
you
probably
did
not
watch

that
you
had
other
things
to
do

is
just
fine

confessed

the

severe

confirmed
my
faith

was
incredulous

ABSTRACT
.
Americans
are
once
again
forced
to
face
the
threat
of
ISIS-inspired
terrorism
,
and
now
it
's
up
to
Donald
Trump
and
the
Republican
leadership
to
make
damn
sure
everyone
knows
how
Hillary
Clinton
caused
this
mess
.
One
of
her
first
power
moves
was
an
attempt
to
buy
auditing
giant
PricewaterhouseCoopers
's
lucrative
consulting
arm
,
believing
the
takeover
would
vindicate
her
sweeping
reorganization
and
net
her
an
early
win
.
But
after
the
deal
was
leaked
to
the
press
,
then
torpedoed
by
the
dot-com
bust
,
HP
was
publicly
embarrassed
.
``
To
my
knowledge
,
there
is
no
heavy-hitter
as
yet
involved
.
My
opinion
is
,
if
this
effort
becomes
more
credible
--
and
it
has
grown
in
credibility
by
leaps
and
bounds

...
it
will
become
an
easier
sell

hopefully
will
attract
one
or
more

these
major
donors

spent
a
lot
of
money
during
the
primary
season
contributing
to
various
pro-Cruz
,
pro-Rubio
,
pro-
Kasich
people
.
''
So
given
that
these
companies
have
the
scores
available
or
can
easily
gain
access
to
them
,
perhaps
the
next
president
could
try
to
require
that
every
company
hand
out
the
ones
they
are
using
to
any
consumer
who
asks
.
People
who
ask
for
one
but
do
not
end
up
becoming
a
customer
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
could
be
required
to
pay
a
nominal
fee
to
cover
the
company
's
costs
.
In
the
meantime
,
it
is
n't
hard
to
find
a
free
credit
score
,
even
if
it
is
n't
the
exact
one
that
your
lender
or
cellphone
company
is
using
.
Discover

one
available
to
anyone
who
signs
up
at
its
website

and
FICO
has

other
companies
to
make
scores

objection

them

most

during

many

One
advantage

that

Tuesday
:
''
You

easily
argue

At

final
debate
before
the
primary
and
at

one
town
hall
,
he
only
hinted
at
Donald

by
mentioning
the
need
for
a
wall
on
the
Mexican
border
and
adding
,
``
I

was
President

the

From

never

about

In
overnight
text
messages
and
conversations
,
Trump
's
advisers
expressed
indignation
at
the
news
coverage
and
immediately
began
to
call
the
plagiarism
allegations
unfair
and
absurd
,
according
to
people
close
to
the
campaign
.
Trump
's
accusation
that
Obama
and
Clinton
created
the
so-called
Islamic
State
extremist
group
had
imperiled
the
lives
of
US
troops
,
Biden
said
.
The
State
Department
deleted
much
of
the
information
about
the
associate
,
including
his
name
and
the
outcome
of
the
job
referral
,
in
turning
over
the
emails
to
Judicial
Watch
.
Clinton
testified
,
for
example
,
that
she
neither
sent
nor
received
emails
marked
classified
,
and
that
she
turned
over
all
her
work-related
emails
to
the
State
Department
.
FBI
Director
James
Comey
said
those
statements
were
wrong
during
a
hearing
last
week
.
She
did
receive
some
emails
with
classified
markings
,
he
said
;
his
agents
found
them
during
their
investigation
.
And
they
also
discovered
thousands
of
work-related
messages
her
lawyers
failed
to
turn
over
,
he
said
.
The
hill
might
even
by
steeper
than
it
appears
:
Sen.
Heidi
Heitkamp
(
D-N.D.
)
opposes
a
Democratic
measure
authorizing
broader
background
checks
,
and
three
of
the
four
GOP
supporters
of
that
proposal
currently
hold
seats
that
Democrats
are
trying
to
win
.
Democrats
would
need
to
pick
up
at
least
15
seats
to
have
enough
votes
to
clear
a
filibuster
on
party
lines
--
and
even
then
there
's
no
guarantee
that
the
next
class
of
Democratic
senators
will
all
support
the
party
's
efforts
to
make
background
checks
mandatory
or
ban
military-style
assault
weapons
.
For
Mrs.
Clinton
in
particular
,
the
ads
are
a
significant
reversal
:
Her
campaign
had
halted
its
advertising
after
her
decisive
victories
in
the
mid-Atlantic
states
on
April
26
,
aside
from
a
brief
return
to
television
in
Kentucky
.
Despite
their
friendship
,
they
playfully
mocked
each
other
at
times
,
doing
imitations
of
each
candidate
and
the
way
they
say
``
huge
turnout
.
''
Paradis
even
tried
on
Bennett
's
Trump
beanie
,
and
laughed
as
people
walked
past
her
looking
puzzled
.
Germany
is
not
moving
fast
enough
for
defense
experts
like
Hans-Peter
Bartels
,
the
parliamentary
commissioner
for
the
military
,
or
Karl-Heinz
Kamp
,
the
president
of
the
government
's
Federal
Academy
for
Security
Policy
.
The
president
left
no
doubt
of
his
commitment
to
helping
Mrs.
Clinton
succeed
him
,
saying
that
''
there
has
never
been
a
man
or
a
woman
-
not
me
,
not
Bill
,
nobody
-
more
qualified
than
Hillary
Clinton
''
to
serve
as
president
.
The
Cadillac
tax
would
gradually
,
though
not
completely
,
reverse
these
incentives
.
The
hope
has
been
that
employers
and
insurers
would
respond
by
finding
ways
to
offer
cheaper
insurance
,
ideally
by
demanding
lower
prices
and
higher
value
,
while
workers
would
end
up
better
off
because
the
extra
money
would
show
up
in
their
paychecks
.
In
the
long
run
,
many
economists
say
,
this
effect
could
ripple
through
the
rest
of
the
health
care
system
,
helping
to
keep
medical
spending
from
rising
too
quickly
.
In
the
2008
South
Carolina
primary
,
with
Barack
Obama
facing
Clinton
,
about
60
percent
of
black
voters
were
over
45
.
In
the
2012
election
,
black
turnout
among
those
ages
18
to
29
was
53
percent
.
It
was
66
percent
among
blacks
30
to
44
and
more
than
70
percent
among
blacks
45
and
older

Following

,
a
state

the
Bush
name
has

some
clout

But
Bush
was
unable
to
break
into
the
top
three
in
South

He
would
likely
have
faced

Nationally
,

Mr.

visibly
active
in
Mrs.

campaign

to
a
New

Times/CBS

poll

Thirty-nine
percent
of
all
Americans
viewed
him
favorably
in
the

50
percent
in
a
similar
survey
in

Presidential
candidates
typically
take
a
timeout
from
the
paid-speech
circuit
to
avoid
potential
conflicts

interest
and
thorny
restrictions
on
mixing
campaign

business
